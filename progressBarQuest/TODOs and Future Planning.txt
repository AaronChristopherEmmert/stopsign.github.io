BUG: holding enter when buying sometimes causes negative numbers.
what?
FOUND: cost increase happened before cost was deducted

In common:
	different numbers besides 0-100
	individual growth rates
	keeping track of it for the row (class?)

notes:
exp is grey and hard to see until hover, then it's white

hover works on all nearby rows, not just current
	color of selection fades out


Variants:
Row completion temporarily improves speed of row above it
	New row costs
	Driver as a buff to the end
	Collector
	All rows are moving all the time
	
Row completion adds progress to the row above it, using a regular Driver
	Driver is the only one moving on it's on
	When driver moves too fast, it switches into bonus
	Alternate variant: Driver has build/expend states
	Add or remove progress bars at will
	
Row completion adds progress to the row above it, using a special Driver
	Build/expend states
	Upgrades focus solely on drivers and collectors
	
Row completion adds progress to the row above it, Resource gain only on Collector completion
	Each collector completion force adds a new row
	Upgrades are powerful because resources are rare.

Row completion adds to velocity of row above it
	Takes a lot of time to reach the collector to start
	Add or remove progress bars at will

Row completion adds speed to a random row

Row completion adds to velocity of one row above it, but subtracts speed from two rows above it.


Variations based on manual actions
	Mouse hover to boost speed/effect of selected row
		Affects multiple rows in proximity to the hovered
	When hovered row completes, gain a bonus
		Maximum micro required. Works best when patterns regularly form
			Catch the pattern would be hella fun
				Variant: this is the *only* way to gain resource

Variations based on two resources
	Alternating rows
		ABAB or AA1A12A123A1234 where numbers improve velocity and letters are speed.
	High-bonus bars horizontally 'split' into next resource
		
Row-specific buffs
	Removes generated patterns to give specific ones
